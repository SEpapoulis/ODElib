ODElib
=======
ODElib is a python module aimed at expediting the analysis of biological systems with ODE models. This is accomplished by creating a model framework object that automatically creates many of the datastructures needed to evaluate model performance after integration. ODElib is well suited for both theoretical explorations of ODEs and testing model fits given experimental data. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo, ODElib can generate posterior distributions of parameters given some parameter priors. By generating posterior distributions given experimental data, biologists can become more precise in describing their experimental system.  




##Installation
Python >=3.7 is required to run ODElib  
ODElib can be directly installed from github with the following:  
`pip install git+https://github.com/SEpapoulis/ODElib#egg=ODElib`  

ODElib is in beta, please submit any issues to github!
