ODElib
=======
ODElib is a python module aimed at expediting the analysis of biological systems with ODE models. This is accomplished by creating a model framework object that automatically creates many of the datastructures needed to evaluate model performance after integration. ODElib is well suited for both theoretical explorations of ODEs and testing model fits given experimental data. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo, ODElib can generate posterior distributions of parameters given some parameter priors. By generating posterior distributions given experimental data, biologists can become more precise in describing their experimental system.  




## Installation  
Python >=3.7 is required to run ODElib  

ODElib can be installed by cloning the repo and installing:  
`cd /dir/you/want`
`git clone https://github.com/SEpapoulis/ODElib.git`
`cd ODElib/`
`pip install .`

Or you can directly install with pip:  
`pip install git+https://github.com/SEpapoulis/ODElib#egg=ODElib`  

## Uninstall
`pip uninstall ODElib`

ODElib is in beta, please submit any issues to github!
